Hello! I'm currently working on my final year project, which is to develop a simple mobile app to improve writer's productivity and overcome writer's block.
This mobile app is like a mini collection game, you record your word count and the number turns into money, allowing you to buy pixel characters. There's more to this app, so there'll be a tutorial/explanation panel provided in the app. 
So if you're interested and would like to lend me a hand with my project, please first fill in the consent form, then download the APK file or PC version linked and try out the demo app yourself, and I would appreciate if you could fill in the evaluation form to let me know how was your experience with this app and useful feedback!
Regarding more specific information on your participation and data protection, please have a look at the participation information sheet. Thanks!
